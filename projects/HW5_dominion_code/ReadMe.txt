Load your dominion.c file into a folder with your OSU username.  Per Assignment 5 instrutions part 1 b:

Have one of your teammates give you their Dominion code and put it in a separate
folder within your project folder. The name of the folder should start with the ONID
of the teammate whose code you are testing. For instance, if you chose to test
robertwen/dominion, create the directory projects/yourONID/roberwenDominion/.

Be careful to only share your dominion.c file with your introduced bugs.
